        <h1 id="home">The First International Workshop on Human Factors for Software Dependability (HFSD)</h1>

        <p><b>Page is currently a work in progress. Check back later for updates.</b></p>

        <p>The first International Workshop on Human Factors for Software Dependability (HFSD), co-located with the 35th IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE 2024), which will be held in Tsukuba, Japan, from October 28 to 31, 2024.</p>

        <p>Software is created by humans and is often used by humans, with the ultimate goal of benefiting humanity. Programming is a cognitive-intensive activity, with human factors playing a significant role in causing faults in programs and inappropriate usages that lead to accidents. Studying how human factors affect the reliability, safety, and security of software systems is crucial for proactively and continuously improving the trustworthiness of these systems.</p>
        
        <p>HFSD is a specialized workshop aims to bring researchers from multiple disciplines together to address the human factors that challenge the reliability, safety, and security of software systems. Interested topics include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Humans as the <i>Designers</i> of Software Systems</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Human errors that cause software defects in various stages of the software development life cycle.</li>
              <li>Interdisciplinary experimental paradigms for studying the cognitive mechanisms behind software defects.</li>
              <li>Various psychological factors that influence software engineersâ€™ tendencies to introduce software defects.</li>
              <li>Biometrics of software engineers in programming, program comprehension, etc.</li>
              <li>Human factors related to software reliability techniques, such as software diversity.</li>
              <li>Human factors as predictors of software reliability.</li>
              <li>Other related topics.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

              <li>User errors that affect the safety of software systems.</li>
              <li>Human factors that affect software security.</li>
              <li>User errors that impact the failures and reliability of software systems.</li>
              <li>Users as predictors of the reliability, safety, and security of software systems.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

        <p>Let's get the whole "linebreak" thing out of the way. The next paragraph contains two phrases separated by a single newline character:</p>

        <p>Roses are red<br>
        Violets are blue</p>

        <p>The next paragraph has the same phrases, but now they are separated by two spaces and a newline character:</p>

        <p>Roses are red<br><br>
        Violets are blue</p>

        <p>Oh, and one thing I cannot stand is the mangling of words with multiple underscores in them like perform_complicated_task or do_this_and_do_that_and_another_thing.</p>

        <h2>A bit of the GitHub spice</h2>

        <p>In addition to the changes in the previous section, certain references are auto-linked:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>SHA: be6a8cc1c1ecfe9489fb51e4869af15a13fc2cd2</li>

          <li>User/Project@SHA: <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/god/commit/be6a8cc1c1ecfe9489fb51e4869af15a13fc2cd2" class="commit-link">mojombo/god@<tt>be6a8cc</tt></a></li>

        </ul>

        <p>These are dangerous goodies though, and we need to make sure email addresses don't get mangled:</p>

        <p>My email addy is <a href="mailto:tom@github.com">tom@github.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>Math is hard, let's go shopping</h2>

        <p>In first grade I learned that 5 &gt; 3 and 2 &lt; 7. Maybe some arrows. 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3. 9 &lt;- 8 &lt;- 7.</p>

        <p>Triangles man! a^2 + b^2 = c^2</p>

        <h2>We all like making lists</h2>

        <p>The above header should be an H2 tag. Now, for a list of fruits:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Red Apples</li>
          <li>Purple Grapes</li>
          <li>Green Kiwifruits</li>
        </ul>


        <p>Let's get crazy:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor<br>
            sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit<br>
            mi posuere lectus.</p>

            <p>Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet<br>
            vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum<br>
            sit amet velit.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <p>What about some code <strong>in</strong> a list? That's insane, right?</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>In Ruby you can map like this:</p>

            <pre><code>['a', 'b'].map { |x| x.uppercase }</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>In Rails, you can do a shortcut:</p>

            <pre><code>['a', 'b'].map(&amp;:uppercase)</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ol>


        <p>Some people seem to like definition lists</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Lower cost</dt>
          <dd>The new version of this product costs significantly less than the previous one!</dd>
          <dt>Easier to use</dt>
          <dd>We've changed the product so that it's much easier to use!</dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>I am a robot</h2>

        <p>Maybe you want to print <code>robot</code> to the console 1000 times. Why not?</p>

        <pre><code>def robot_invasion
  puts("robot " * 1000)
end
</code></pre>

        <p>You see, that was formatted as code because it's been indented by four spaces.</p>

        <p>How about we throw some angle braces and ampersands in there?</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;div class="footer"&gt;
    &amp;copy; 2004 Foo Corporation
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

        <h2>Set in stone</h2>

        <p>Preformatted blocks are useful for ASCII art:</p>

        <pre>             ,-.
    ,     ,-.   ,-.
   / \   (   )-(   )
   \ |  ,.&gt;-(   )-&lt;
    \|,' (   )-(   )
     Y ___`-'   `-'
     |/__/   `-'
     |
     |
     |    -hrr-
  ___|_____________
</pre>

        <h2>Playing the blame game</h2>

        <p>If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I<br>
        could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in<br>
        the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to<br>
        come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...</p>

        <p>I don't want to sound like<br>
        I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you<br>
        just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet<br>
        as I should be in coming up with one.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Table for two</h2>

        <table>
          <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>ID</th>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Rank</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>1</td>
        <td>Tom Preston-Werner</td>
        <td>Awesome</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2</td>
        <td>Albert Einstein</td>
        <td>Nearly as awesome</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Crazy linking action</h2>

        <p>I get 10 times more traffic from <a href="http://google.com/" title="Google">Google</a> than from<br>
