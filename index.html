        <p>Software is created by humans and is often used by humans, with the ultimate goal of benefiting humanity. Programming is a cognitive-intensive activity, with human factors playing a significant role in causing faults in programs and inappropriate usages that lead to accidents. Studying how human factors affect the reliability, safety, and security of software systems is crucial for proactively and continuously improving the trustworthiness of these systems.</p>
        
        <p>HFSD is a specialized workshop aims to bring researchers from multiple disciplines together to address the human factors that challenge the reliability, safety, and security of software systems. Interested topics include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Humans as the <i>Designers</i> of Software Systems</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Human errors that cause software defects in various stages of the software development life cycle.</li>
              <li>Interdisciplinary experimental paradigms for studying the cognitive mechanisms behind software defects.</li>
              <li>Various psychological factors that influence software engineersâ€™ tendencies to introduce software defects.</li>
              <li>Biometrics of software engineers in programming, program comprehension, etc.</li>
              <li>Human factors related to software reliability techniques, such as software diversity.</li>
              <li>Human factors as predictors of software reliability.</li>
              <li>Other related topics.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Humans as the <i>Users</i> of Software Systems</b>
            <ul>
              <li>User errors that affect the safety of software systems.</li>
              <li>Human factors that affect software security.</li>
              <li>User errors that impact the failures and reliability of software systems.</li>
              <li>Users as predictors of the reliability, safety, and security of software systems.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Humans as <i>Beneficiaries</i> of Software Systems</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Social and ethical issues of AI software systems.</li>
              <li>Human safety of autonomous systems.</li>
            </ul>
